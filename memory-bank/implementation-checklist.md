### âœ… Feature Toggle Movement
- **Task**: Move FeatureCard toggle from AssetMeta component to main asset information area next to language selector
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**: 
  - Removed FeatureCard component from AssetMeta.js
  - Added feature toggle functionality directly to ComposeAsset.js

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Details

### Navigation Structure:
```
Growth
â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ Reviews  
â”œâ”€â”€ Sales (Won Leads)
â”œâ”€â”€ FormEntry Leads â†’ /growth/leads ðŸ†•
â”œâ”€â”€ Signups â†’ /growth/invites-signups ðŸ†•
â”œâ”€â”€ URL Shortener
â””â”€â”€ Settings
```

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Flat Navigation**: "All Leads" replaced with two separate menu items
- **User Invites Management**: Complete CRUD operations for user invites
- **Filtering**: Status, role, and academy-based filtering
- **Bulk Actions**: Resend multiple invites at once
- **API Integration**: Uses existing auth endpoint `/v1/auth/academy/user/invite`
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Follows existing styling patterns
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for all actions

### API Endpoints Used:
- `GET /v1/auth/academy/user/invite` - Fetch user invites
- `PUT /auth/member/invite/resend/{id}` - Resend invite
- `DELETE /auth/academy/user/invite` - Delete invites

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing

The implementation is now complete and ready for testing. The new navigation structure allows users to:

1. Access traditional form-entry leads via "Growth > FormEntry Leads"
2. View and manage user invites via "Growth > Signups"
3. Perform bulk operations on both types of data
4. Filter and search within each section independently

All code follows the existing patterns and conventions used throughout the application. 

## Notes
- Both files pass syntax validation
- Feature toggle maintains same API integration and toast notifications
- Uses appropriate Material-UI components (Switch, FormControlLabel, Tooltip)
- Properly integrated with existing state management
